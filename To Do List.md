- [ ] playing in key with level 2-4
- [ ] user testing
- [ ] add relative minor to the key list in the 1 key 1 finger 1 chord section
- [ ] fix the bugs that are related to midi keyboard input
  - [ ] sustain lengths seem to be limited to when the keys are held down

  - [ ] note input is still a bit finicky in terms of detection

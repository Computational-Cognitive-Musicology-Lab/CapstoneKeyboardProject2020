# Informal User Interface Testing Notes
I will be referring to these people by their initials for privacy purposes. This was very informal testing. I let them try out v0.1 of the chord trainer and set the interface to presentation mode.

## CHW
- took piano lessons as a kid
- does not currently participate in music performance
- does listen to music often

### Long form notes during testing
Had trouble finding how to turn on keyboard. Did not read the instructions very carefully. Started dicking around in single key mode. Messed with the modes. Didn't read the instructions. Is baby. Successfully found sustain slider. Seems to be having more luck in Casio mode. Found out he could click on the piano. Earlier thought the button for turning on keyboard input on screen was clickable. Subject is a lazy shit and didn't want to read the words. "I am a cs major, I know how to explore".

### Long form notes during testing
Found keyboard usage key. Tried out improved version. Seemed to be able to figure out chords. Seemed to do pretty alright. Spent quite a while playing with the improved chord mode. Asked if he knew there were other modes. He said he had but hadn't tried them yet. "I'm not sure I have opinions yet but I'm having a fun time." Probably didn't see the info under the modes. Not all the key combinations work which is a hardware thing. Says he probably wouldn't be able to figure out how to play a chord given the instructions on screen. Definitely want to make the documentation easier to understand

## ZR
- says he hasn't played piano in a long time

### Long form notes during testing
First impression: Can see keys from diagram. What have you noticed about the interface? "I'm just pressing buttons." Has no clue what any of the chord types mean. Really likes the sustain length slider.

I tested the program with a midi keyboard.

known bugs:
- [ ] sustain lengths seem to be limited to when the keys are held down
  - [ ] possibly the sustain length might only apply to computer keyboard because of noteoff messages that get sent
- [ ] note input is still a bit finicky in terms of detection
